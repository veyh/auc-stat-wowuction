# Auc:Stat:WoWuction

Updated for WoD and latest TSM, which has removed support for WoWuction. This uses TSM's AuctionDB instead.

## Installation

1. Download the latest release from https://github.com/veyh/auc-stat-wowuction/releases
2. Extract it into your `<WoW>/Interface/AddOns` folder, *overwriting all existing files*.
3. Happy Auctioning!
